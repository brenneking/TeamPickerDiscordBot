# TeamPickerDiscordBot
Randomly selects two teams based on who is in a voice channel on Discord

## What I Learned
- The ins and outs of Python as this was my first project written in Python
- How to properly utlize libraries provided by others
## How to Run
- Create a developer account for Discord and create your bot through their developer portal
- A token will be given to the bot and you insert those tokens where I stated to insert it
- This bot is specifically designed for the game Valorant, but you can modify it to work for other games by changing maps and name of the sides
- On the command line, type 'python3 TeamPickerDiscordBot.py'
